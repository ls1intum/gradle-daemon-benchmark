# gradle-daemon-benchmark

This tool is used to benchmark the performance of Gradle builds. It uses the [Gradle Profiler](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/inspect.html#profile_report) to run the benchmarks. The tool is implemented as a Docker image.
The tool requires a `profiles` directory to be mounted to the Docker image. The `profiles` directory will contain the performance profiles generated by the Gradle Profiler. 
The tool also requires a `tests` directory to be copied to the Docker image. The `tests` directory will contain the tests for the programming exercise. This directory have to be cloned manually from the repository of the programming exercise.
The tool also requires a `repo.txt` file containing the repositories of the programming exercise. The tool will clone the repositories and run the benchmarks on them. The tool will generate a performance profile for each repository. The performance profiles will be stored in the `profiles` directory.

Ideally, the first entry of the `repo.txt` file is the empty exercise repository. The format of the file is as follows:

```text
<repository-url-with-username-and-password>
https://username:password@repository-url
```

Build a Docker image with the following command:

```bash
docker build -t gradle-benchmark .
```

Run the Docker image with the following command:

```bash
docker run -v ./profiles:/profiles -it gradle-benchmark
```

You should now see all the performance profiles in the `profiles` directory.
